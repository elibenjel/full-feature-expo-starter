# Screens folder

Organize the screens of the app as needed in this folder.
These screen components are then imported in the expo-router app folder, to build the screens of the app.
This organization is useful to not mix expo-router code with business code, and not being constrained
by expo-router conventions present in the app folder.


Example of structure:

-- auth
---- otp.tsx
-- dashboard
---- components
------ MyLocalComponent.tsx
---- screen-using-my-local-component.tsx
-- status
---- error.tsx
